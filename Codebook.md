# Description of meansdperrow.csv

The meansdperrow.csv file contains both the training and testing data's rows.

The first column contains an identifier for the row.  This is an auto-generated identifier.

The column with the header Activity contains the name of the activity which the subject person was engaged in.

The column with the header Subject contains the integral identifer to identify the person who is the subject of the experimental instance.

There are many rows having the same pairing of Activity and Subject because the same person did the same activity multiple times.

## body\_acc\_x\_train.txt and body\_acc\_x\_test.txt based columns (also y and z direction):

BodyAccXMean column contains the mean of the BodyAccX motion of the instance of experiment.
BodyAccXSd column contains the mean of the BodyAccX motion of the instance of experiment. 

BodyAccYMean column contains the mean of the BodyAccY motion of the instance of experiment.
BodyAccYSd column contains the mean of the BodyAccY motion of the instance of experiment. 

BodyAccZMean column contains the mean of the BodyAccZ motion of the instance of experiment.
BodyAccZSd column contains the mean of the BodyAccZ motion of the instance of experiment.

## body\_gyro\_x\_train.txt and body\_gyro\_x\_train.txt based columns (also y and z direction):

BodyGyroXMean column contains the mean of the BodyGyroX motion of the instance of experiment.
BodyGyroXSd column contains the mean of the BodyGyroX motion of the instance of experiment. 

BodyGyroYMean column contains the mean of the BodyGyroY motion of the instance of experiment.
BodyGyroYSd column contains the mean of the BodyGyroY motion of the instance of experiment. 

BodyGyroZMean column contains the mean of the BodyGyroZ motion of the instance of experiment.
BodyGyroZSd column contains the mean of the BodyGyroZ motion of the instance of experiment.

# Description of meanperactivitysubject.csv

The first column, having no header, is just the identifier integral number for the row.

The column with the header Activity contains the name of the activity which the subject person was engaged in.

The column with the header Subject contains the integral identifer to identify the person who is the subject of the experimental instances.   Any particular instance has been aggregated by the grouping of Activity and Subject.

## body\_acc\_x\_train.txt and body\_acc\_x\_test.txt based columns (also y and z direction):

BodyAccXMean column contains the mean of the BodyAccX motion of the instances of experiment.
 
BodyAccYMean column contains the mean of the BodyAccY motion of the instances of experiment.
